# This Is My Third Weekly Assignment
Hello, i am Resyana Cahyanita. 23 years old girl in +8 GMT (East Borneo) timezone. Currently im working as Tax Collector and soon to be software engineer!

For my third weekly assignment, i made this website that consists custom font using font-face, text-shadow to text, 2 responsive background image, one responsive image with picture + souce +srcset method, asymetrical grid, one advanced form (date), and simple animation (animation and transition).

The theme of the website is one of the famous HBO Serie "Game Of Thrones". This is the website fansite so i give a little information about seasons of GOT and prequel of its franchise.

<h1>Explaination</h1>
	This is a responsive website. There are hamburger menu that changes when the screen becomes mobile screen with media query and i add the hover effects that select elements when you mouse over them. 
	For the Header i made with sticky nav bar, wherever you scroll the website it sticks to its position. The form section includes input type of text, textarea, date, submit button, radio buttons, file, and checkboxes. My personal favorite of this website are the text animation and flip-card.
   The grid are assymetrical whenever you move the mouse, it changes from grayscale to original filter. Lastly i gave the image carousel using HTML and CSS only.
